### 👨‍💻 About me:

I am a beginner front-end developer with a great passion for IT technologies. Your path to IT
I started when I was only 13 years old. At first I tried my hand at the backend, but I didn’t like it and decided to go to the frontend. I know the basics of two languages (Python and C++)

### 🌱 My experience
Now I’m learning front-end development (JavaScript, KSS and HTML5), before that, I persistently studied Python and C++ for 2 years and successfully mastered their base. My efforts in learning these two languages allowed me not only to understand the basics of programming, but also to start creating my own projects (I can’t find them now, since they were on an old computer...)

- 🔭 Successfully completed 2 Python courses on Stepik
- ⚡I really want to master the IT profession and find a job
