### 👨‍💻 About me:

I am an aspiring programmer with a great passion for the world of information technology. I am currently 16 years old and I started my exciting journey into the world of programming when I was only 13 years old.

🌱My experience For a year and a half I paid intense attention to the Python language and successfully mastered its basics. My efforts in learning Python allowed me to not only understand the basics of programming, but also to begin solving real-world problems and creating my own programs. I'm currently actively learning C++, expanding my skills and horizons in the world of programming. This language provides me with new opportunities and challenges that I look forward to.
